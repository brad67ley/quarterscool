    <h1>THE MILE AT SCHOOL</h1>
    <p>Basically, in school today we had to do the pacer test thing and we had to run a mile in less than 12 minutes, I however am not conditioned for that stuff sadly so I got REALLY tired on the third lap and I was STRUGGLING. Then when I heard "ONE MINUTE LEFT!" I decided that was the time to not care about ANYTHING or ANYONE and just straight up RAN. I LUCKILY got 11:56 as my time, just barley passing.</p>
